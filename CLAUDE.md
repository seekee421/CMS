# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a Content Management System (CMS) project that is currently in early stages, as evidenced by the repository structure containing only configuration files and no main source code files yet.

## Repository Structure

- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local settings with file permissions for Claude access
  - `.claude/agents/` - Directory for Claude agent configurations

## Available Commands

Since this is a new repository with no committed source code yet, the following commands can be used to initialize and develop the project:

```bash
# Initialize the repository if starting from scratch
git init

# Set up your development environment based on the type of CMS you're building
# (Node.js, Python, etc.) - specific commands to be added once project type is determined
```

## Development Setup

The project appears to be in initial setup phase. When adding code:
- Follow standard development practices for your chosen technology stack
- Add appropriate build, test, and lint configurations as the project develops
- Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific development commands and architecture details as the codebase grows
